  "question": "what are distributed systems in simple terms and how to prevent single point of failure",
  "answer": "Distributed systems are systems where multiple components work together across different locations to achieve a common goal. To prevent single points of failure in a system, redundancy can be added by introducing more nodes or regions, replicating data, and ensuring fault-tolerance.",

    "How do regions and multiple regions help prevent single points of failure in a system?",
    "Can you explain the concept of fault-tolerance in the context of distributed systems?",

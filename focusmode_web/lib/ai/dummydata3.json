What image does that pod need to run? It needs to run this image right? 100xdev slash ENV backend. The one that I was running locally. Now I want to run inside Kubernetes. I was running it inside Docker before. Now I want to run in my Kubernetes cluster. So how can I do that? I will have to create either a deployment. Or a pod doesn't matter. You can choose either. Let's create a deployment. Let's see if we have one here. We do this deployment is sort of important. Even though it looks very big, it's actually not that big. It says create a deployment where was deployment introduced in the apps slash V1 version of Kubernetes. This is the name of my deployment. It should start one pod finally. I can of course increase this to two, three whatever.",

I can use it to run it locally using Docker or I can use it to run it in my Kubernetes cluster. How can I run it in my Kubernetes cluster? I have to create a deployment. I have to create a deployment. Which says, here you are a deployment. This is your name. You're going to have one replica, one copy. This is how you match the pods that you are creating.

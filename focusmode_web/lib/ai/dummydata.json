  "answer": "To overcome the limitations of network calls in terms of scalability and data consistency, one strategy is to use a combination of vertical scaling and horizontal scaling. Vertical scaling involves buying a bigger machine to process requests faster, while horizontal scaling involves distributing requests among multiple machines to handle more traffic. Another strategy is to implement inter-process communication for faster communication between servers, instead of relying on slow network calls.",

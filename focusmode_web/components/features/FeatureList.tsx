            Living with ADHD means time can slip through your fingers like
            water. Our floating focus timer was specifically designed for people
            with ADHD symptoms who struggle with time blindness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike traditional timers that get buried under windows, our
            always-visible companion stays gently present. It works with your
            ADHD attention patterns, keeping you connected to reality without
            adding to the noise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our users report saving 8-10 hours weekly by staying in focus mode,
            finally breaking free from the cycle of time blindness that comes
            with hyperactivity disorder.
